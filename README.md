# About the game
This is a coding game. It's based on the excellent [Elevator Saga programming game by Magnus Wolffelt](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga). 
This is a server side implementation of the game so that .NET languagues can be used.

Your task is to program the movement of elevators, by writing a program in a .NET language of your choice.

The goal is to transport people in an efficient manner.
Depending on how well you do it, you can progress through the ever more difficult challenges.
Only the very best programs will be able to complete all the challenges.
